              One of the most recent discussions surrounding the use of technology by children and teenagers is the time they spend on smartphones and iPads. Steve Jobs I was part of the group that didnâ€™t think it was a good idea for children to grow up addicted to these devices.

               Part of AccorHotels the building is just beautiful. It was designed by E. Keynes Purchase
                in association with Durward Brown and was completed in 1923. It had a long life as a bank for many
                years before the French hotel group took it over and turned it into this fabulous hotel.

                The dark marble reception desk with its green cushioned backdrop and seemingly sky-high ceilings
                suggest that pleasure is a serious business delivered with precision. Staff are amazingly attentive
                and as this is a French hotel you are greeted in both French and English.
